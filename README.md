# RoomReservingatOSU
Students have massive difficulty searching for study rooms on campus to use for personal use, group use, and/or practice a presentation.  Examples of high-priority rooms include those with projectors, HDMI hook up, whiteboards, quiet areas, and outlets -- just to name a few. Our application would like to target students with specific needs to observe which rooms have available equipment, are empty, and provide the most optimal study space for their needs.
